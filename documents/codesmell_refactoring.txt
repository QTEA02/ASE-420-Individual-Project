Week 4-5:
First V1 Iteration
1. Dead code for class TimeRecord.
Refactoring: Remove class

2. Data Duplication was found in the create_table method in DatabaseHandler which contains the same SQL query used for table creation as a string literal and in the execute_query method.
Refactoring: Remove instances of table creation, and just have it reference the class that contains the instance.

Second V1 Iteration
3. Switch statements found in the QueryHandler class
Refactoring:

4. Nested while loop in the provide_options method of UserHandler 
Refactoring:

5. Magic numbers; the choices "1", "2", and "3" in the QueryHandler class 
Refactoring:

6. Mixed logic with UserHandler class, and TimeRecordRepository. UserHandler needs to handle only input logic. Violates SRP.
Refactoring: (Maybe add an output handler class)
