As a student, I want to be able to record my time usage.  

- As a user, I want to use a system that can record time using various date and time formats, including date in "YYYY/MM/DD" form and the option to specify "AM" or "PM."
- As a user, I want to type "today 7:30 AM 8:30 PM studied Python :STUDY" as input and have that information stored in the database as a record
- As a user, I want to query information from the database by DATE, TASK, or TAG. It should return all activities associated by the query.
