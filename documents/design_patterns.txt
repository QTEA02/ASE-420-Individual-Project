Strategy Pattern:
- The QueryHandler class encapsulates different query types (DateQuery, TaskQuery, TagQuery) as strategies for handling different types of queries.

Proxy:
-  TimeRecordRepository class intercepts the communication between the handler and the database and creates the query. 

Mediator Pattern 
- The main (program.py) file imports all of the classes, and is a centralized communication medium between all the classes in the program.
